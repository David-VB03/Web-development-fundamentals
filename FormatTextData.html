     <h1><em>NEVER EVER CHANGES</em></h1>
     
     <h2>Artist :<u>Nico  Collins</u></h2>
  
     <p>Lyrics: <del>(Version Nightcore)</del></p>
    <p>I woke up in a modern world
And there's nothing I can do
While I read the latest, from the breaking
Story on the news
People swear they say it's fake
And look up to our leader
As he speaks from a mind so bleak
He preys on his believers
Everyone's bitter, pointing their fingers
Seeing the worst in each other
But people are not, their skin, or their God
Or who they claim their lover
I think that people are made so unequal
Some are born good and some evil
And so here I pray, for one single day
We can live here peaceful
<strong>The world is falling down
And nothing ever changes </strong>
1, 2, 3 as the shots ring out
But nothing ever changes
<strong>The world is falling down</strong>
And nothing ever changes
We're all part of a silent crowd
'Cause nothing ever changes
12 more killed at a local bar
Some were only 21
But the NRA has bills to pay and feeds us with more guns
So we send our thoughts and prayers
To those who lost their lives
But the cycle stays and in a couple of days
Bullets fly and a few more die
I'm not a scholar, I'm not an expert but if you fight fire with fire
I'm pretty sure, it only gets worse
The flames burn even brighter
I know that I'm not alone
When I say I'm sick of the violence
Voice our anger on our phones
But in real life we're quiet (shhh)
<strong>The world is falling down</strong>
And nothing ever changes
1, 2, 3 as the shots ring out
But nothing ever changes
<strong>The world is falling down</strong>
And nothing ever changes
We're all part of a silent crowd
'Cause nothing ever changes
I hope that when, I fast forward
Twenty something years
We no longer live our days in hatred or in fear
And live to be, kind and free
To do unto each other
As you'd have 'em do, unto you
United undercover
<strong>The world is falling down</strong>
And nothing ever changes
1, 2, 3 as the shots ring out
But nothing ever changes
<strong>The world is falling down</strong>
And nothing ever changes
We're all part of a silent crowd
'Cause nothing ever changes
<strong>The world is falling down</strong>
Nothing ever changes
<strong>The world is falling down</strong> now
Cuz nothing ever changes
<strong>The world is falling down</strong>
Nothing ever changes
<strong>The world is falling down</strong> now
Cuz nothing ever changes
